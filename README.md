# Liri-Bot

Liri Bot is a node application that takes user input in the command line and searches 3 different APIs. concert-this band/artist name will return the 5 most upcoming venue names, locations and the dates of the shows for that band/artist. spotify-this-song song name will search spotify for that song and return the artist, song title, and ablum. If you do not enter a song name it will default to searching for "The Sign" by Ace of Base. movie-this movie title will search the OMBD API and return the movie title, release year, IMDB rating and Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Country of production, language, actors and plot. If you do not enter a movie title Liri Bot will default and search Mr Nobody. Finally, do-what-it-says will import text from a txt file and do what it says (currently it says to spotify-this-song I Want it that Way). All of these searches are logges onto a log.txt file.
